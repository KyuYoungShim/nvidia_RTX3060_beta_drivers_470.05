# nvidia_RTX3060_beta_drivers_470.05
ETHEREUM MINING OPTIMIZED NVIDIA RTX 3060 (regular or the new XC) that allow a full normal hashrate for ethash (approx. 50MHs)

So it appears that NVIDIA recently fucked around with the drivers of (previous?) and/or new RTX 3060 (XC and/or reg) so that it can only generate approx. half of the normal approx. 50MHs hashrate in ethash. Other algos are not conerned (RVN, etc.)

So, since I absolutely but ENTIRELY and strongly disagree with that scandalous and absurd attitude (thanks, Nvidia, cool move for miners...), I am making available for download leaked Beta 470.05 drivers that (I confirm it works 100%) allow full ethash hashrate aopprox. 50MHs. But:

1. I can't make it work on a 1x PCie riser; apparently it takes at least 8x. Confirmed working on a Z390 ASUS directly on the 16x slot (I know, it sucks...)
2. GPU *must* be the display (i.e. have a DP or HDMI plugged in to an active, powered-on screen output). **Friend of mine reports that HDMI dummy works too, can't confirm.
3. I would also perform a full NVIDIA DDU to make sure things work properly.

Voil√†. Happy mining and may the cryptoeconomy take all the place soon.
